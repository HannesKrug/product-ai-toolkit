# About
This is the brand book of Threedy.
Threedy develops and provides instant3Dhub, the first
Spatial-Computing-as-a-Service platform.
Building on the foundation of instant3Dhub, we help our customers to make
their 3D data available throughout their entire business and thereby its
(possessive) for the company.

Our Customers
Pioneering Research in 3D Visualization
We’re here to support them.
Our allies are the masterminds – the digitalization leaders, engineers, developers, and business stakeholders
within industrial enterprises, from mobility and machinery to energy, large-scale infrastructure, and complex
equipment. They create and operate vehicles, factories, power plants, machines, and components that must
operate flawlessly for years, all while facing increasing pressure on cost, sustainability, and time-to-market.
Every day, they wrestle with massive and fragmented 3D data. CAD models, factory layouts and digital twins
need to be available, trustworthy and up to date for everyone: R&D, production, quality, sales and marketing,
service and management. When this doesn’t work, decisions slow down, errors slip through and innovation
stalls.
At Threedy, we exist to take that burden away. instant3Dhub becomes the invisible backbone that streams
their 3D data, connects it with business context and makes it usable in real time, on any device, across the
entire value chain. Our technology is important – but the real achievement belongs to our customers. They are
the ones building safer cars, running smarter factories and shaping a more sustainable, efficient industrial
world.
We feel privileged to stand alongside them, reliably in the background so they can focus on what they do best:
turning complex ideas and data into real-world impact.

Our Story
From pioneering research at Fraunhofer IGD to enabling industries worldwide – discover the story behind
Threedy.
Our Journey: From Research to Revolutionizing 3D Data.
Pioneering Research in 3D Visualization.
Threedy’s origins trace back to the 1990s at Fraunhofer IGD, where our team conducted groundbreaking
research in 3D visualization. These efforts led to key software solutions like VRCOM, instantReality, OpenSG,
and x3dom – empowering industry professionals worldwide.
From Spin-Off to Industry Game-Changer.
Between 2016 and 2020, we prepared for commercialization through funding programs and strategic
planning. In September 2020, Threedy officially spun off from Fraunhofer IGD, securing early investments from
matterwave, HTGF, and Fraunhofer itself.
2020 – Threedy is founded, spinning off from Fraunhofer IGD
2022 – Multi-year contracts with BMW, Trumpf
2023 – €10 million Series A funding for international expansion


Mission & Vision
Our Mission: Redefining Industrial Workflows
We create foundational technology to enable integrated spatial twins that interweave data
and realities to blur the boundaries between digital and physical spaces and overcome
information locality for the industrial workers of the future.

Our Vision: The Future of Spatial Data
We believe that spatial data will be the key enabler and accelerator for the fusion of
industrial technology with human experience.

Brand Personality
Who is Threedy?
We are driven by curiosity, the urge to create something unique, pride in our
results, and the satisfaction of our customers.
With our technology, we enable completely new ways of working and
fundamentally improve the working environment of our customers.

We take an analytical approach and create innovation for real problems, not as an end in itself. We act quickly
when the situation requires it, but we build for the long term. We value speed, but not at the expense of
quality. For us, this is not a contradiction.
We ask the right questions early on, because we want to solve real problems and move our customers
forward.
We are tech nerds and proud of it.
We are committed, actively driving things forward, removing obstacles, and delivering on our promises. No
excuses, only solutions — we take responsibility for our results.
We are direct but always friendly, cooperative by nature, and appreciate honest feedback. We are reliable and
communicate clearly and transparently, because this is the only way we can continuously learn, iterate quickly,
and focus on what is really important.
We rely on clear agreements and expectations — towards our customers and among each other. We are
always helpful and share information freely to make each other better.
We win as a team.

Typography
Primary: Nunito Sans
Nunito Sans is a modern geometric sans-serif chosen for its superior readability and clean, precise shapes. Its
squared dot accents (i, ü, ö, ä) subtly reference a cubic form, creating a visual link to our 3D design language.
This makes the typeface feel naturally aligned with our brand’s logic, clarity, and structure.
License:
Nunito Sans is released under the SIL Open Font License (OFL 1.1). It is free for both personal and commercial
use, including modification and redistribution.

Typography — Do / Don’t
Do
• Use Nunito Sans as the primary typeface across marketing, sales, website, and interface materials.
• Apply the defined heading hierarchy (H1–H4) with correct sizes, weights, tracking, line-height, and
uppercase rules.
• Use Montserrat only when Nunito Sans cannot be installed or embedded (e.g. internal documents,
collaboration tools).
• Use Arial as a Web Safe fallback for email signatures or systems that support only native fonts.
• Keep consistent spacing: use a line-height of 1 everywhere, and follow it consistently. Tracking is
standard everywhere unless a different value is specified.
• Use uppercase only where defined, especially for selection labels and H1, as shown in the system.
• Follow the reverse heading structure displayed in the style guide (H1 – largest, H4 – smallest).
• All text is always left-aligned. Headlines can be centered when required by the layout; otherwise, they
should be left-aligned.

Don’t
• Don’t replace Nunito Sans with other fonts unless technically unavoidable.
• Don’t mix multiple typefaces in one layout (except approved fallbacks).
• Don’t use Montserrat when Nunito Sans is available and embeddable.
• Don’t manually modify spacing (line-height, tracking) outside of defined specs.
• Don’t use lowercase where uppercase is required by the style rules.
• Don’t scale or stretch text to imitate other heading sizes — always use the predefined styles.

Images
For background visuals, use authentic industrial and 3D engineering scenes—complex assemblies, factory
layouts, engines, and components that reflect our customers’ work. Prioritize technical imagery aligned with
Threedy’s focus on spatial data and real-time visualization.

Pictograms
A pictogram is a simplified visual symbol that communicates a concept instantly, making technical information
easier to grasp at a glance. In Threedy’s context, pictograms support clarity when presenting complex 3D
data, workflows, or system structures.
Use pictograms thoughtfully and with restraint. They should highlight key points, guide understanding, and
reinforce Threedy’s precise and professional visual language. Apply them only when they add real value and
enhance comprehension—never as decoration.
The source of our pictograms is Flaticon or Freepick. Every time we download icons with the Premium account,
we download also the license attached to the icon.
#0d1732
#c1c6d3
These pictograms are intended for use at larger sizes (up to 64x64px) compared to standard interface icons
(typically 24x24px). This ensures that the intricate details remain clear and legible.


UI Design System
Usability is a fundamental part of the Threedy experience.
When working with large-scale, mission-critical 3D data, a clear and efficient workflow is more important
than visual embellishment. instant3Dhub is engineered to give users full control over complex operations
while keeping interactions fast, predictable, and scalable.
Our interface remains clean, precise, and distinctly professional — reflecting the reliability of our technology
and reinforcing confidence in the accuracy, performance, and enterprise-grade quality our customers expect
from Threedy.

Pattern
For Threedy, visual accents should reflect the essence of instant3Dhub — high-performance 3D, scalability,
and technical excellence. We use subtle spatial-computing–inspired patterns: abstract 3D grids, point clouds,
depth-layer lines, or lightweight mesh structures. These elements visually communicate precision,
computational power, and our ability to handle complex data at scale. Use them sparingly as background
accents or beneath imagery to create depth without distraction. Keep usage limited to 1–2 elements per page
to preserve a clean, enterprise-grade look and ensure the design remains focused, modern, and trustworthy.
