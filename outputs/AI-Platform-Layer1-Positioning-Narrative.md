## **1. Problem: AI's Potential in Engineering is High—But 3D Stays Locked Behind Complex Tooling**

**The situation:**
- Engineering VPs see AI's potential for their workflows
- But unlocking that potential is difficult
- 3D/CAD data remains trapped in complex, fragmented toolchains
- Building scalable AI solutions for engineering processes is hard

**The challenge:**
- AI can't access engineering data in a meaningful way
- Every attempt requires custom integrations with CAD systems, PLM tools, and knowledge bases
- Prototypes work, but scaling to production is complex
- Teams spend months on infrastructure instead of use cases

**The core issue:**
*3D data is locked behind a wall of complex CAD tooling—making it nearly impossible for AI to work with engineering information at scale.*

---

## **2. Insight: AI Needs to Understand 3D Data—Not Just Text**

**The fundamental challenge:**

Most AI today works with text-based inputs. But engineering isn't text—it's **3D geometry, spatial relationships, and contextual knowledge**.

**What AI actually needs to understand:**
- **3D geometry and features** (not just 2D images or descriptions)
- **Engineering metadata** (tolerances, materials, manufacturing constraints)
- **Company knowledge** (requirements, norms, standards, market contexts)
- **Process information** (design rules, approval workflows, compliance criteria)

**The key realization:**
AI can only add value to engineering when it understands 3D data and connects it to your company's knowledge systems.

## **4. What Becomes Possible: Reusable 3D-AI Capabilities**

With instant3Dhub as your foundation, you can build:

- **Natural Language 3D Interaction** – Engineers ask questions, AI finds answers in 3D models
- **MCP-Based Tool Integration** – AI agents access CAD tools and engineering systems directly
- **Knowledge Graph-Connected Engineering** – AI reasons across requirements, standards, and models
- **AR-Assisted Quality Assurance** – Bring AI insights to the shopfloor
- **Automated 3D Reviews** – AI checks designs against rules and standards
- **Training Data Pipelines** – Generate high-quality 3D datasets for custom AI models

**Key principle:** Start small with one use case. Scale across multiple applications because the platform is reusable.
