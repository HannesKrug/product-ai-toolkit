## **HERO SECTION**

### Headline
**Make Your Engineering Data AI-Ready**

### Subheadline
The platform that connects AI to 3D/CAD systems—enabling scalable AI workflows for engineering.

### CTA Button
**[Get Early Access]**

### Visual Needed:
**Hero Image:** Split-screen visual
- **Left side:** Complex CAD assembly (engine, machinery) locked behind a translucent barrier/wall with CAD tool icons (SolidWorks, CATIA, NX logos)
- **Right side:** Same 3D model but "unlocked," with AI agent icons interacting with it (chat bubbles, annotations, highlights on features)
- **Bridge between:** instant3Dhub logo/platform connecting the two sides

---

## **SECTION 1: THE CHALLENGE**

### Headline
**AI's Potential in Engineering is High—But 3D Data Stays Locked**

### Copy
Engineering teams see AI's potential. But accessing 3D/CAD data for AI workflows is hard.

**The problem:**
- 3D data trapped in complex CAD toolchains
- Custom integrations take months
- Prototypes don't scale to production

### Visual Needed:
**Diagram:** "The 3D Data Wall"
- Central illustration: Large 3D model behind a brick wall
- Around the wall: Scattered CAD tool icons (SolidWorks, CATIA, Creo, NX, PLM systems)
- On the other side: AI agents trying to reach the data but blocked
- Labels: "Fragmented toolchains," "Complex integrations," "Locked data"

## **SECTION 2: THE INSIGHT**

### Headline
**AI Needs to Understand 3D—Not Just Text**

### Copy
Most AI works with text. Engineering works with 3D geometry, spatial relationships, and contextual knowledge.

**AI needs:**
- 3D geometry and features
- Engineering metadata (tolerances, materials, constraints)
- Company knowledge (requirements, norms, standards)

### Visual Needed:
**Side-by-side comparison:**
- **Left panel:** "Text-based AI" – Shows ChatGPT-style interface with text description of a part (flat, limited)
- **Right panel:** "3D-aware AI" – Shows instant3Dhub interface with 3D model + connected knowledge graph nodes (requirements, standards, metadata)
- Arrow between panels labeled: "instant3Dhub bridges the gap"

## **SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION**

### Headline
**instant3Dhub: The Platform That Makes 3D/CAD Data AI-Accessible**

### Copy
Connect AI to your engineering data—without months of custom integration work.

**What instant3Dhub provides:**
- **Unified 3D Data Access** – Any CAD system, any format
- **AI-Native Tool Integration (MCP)** – Engineering tools become AI-accessible
- **Contextual Knowledge Integration** – Connect 3D models with company knowledge
- **Enterprise-Ready Platform** – Start small, scale across use cases

### Visual Needed:
**Platform Architecture Diagram:**
- **Bottom layer:** CAD tools (SolidWorks, CATIA, NX icons) + PLM + Knowledge base icons
- **Middle layer:** instant3Dhub platform (with MCP logo/badge)
- **Top layer:** AI agents/applications (GPT, Claude, custom AI icons)
- **Arrows:** Data flowing up from CAD → through instant3Dhub → to AI agents
- **Callout badge:** "MCP Integration" highlighted

## **SECTION 4: WHAT YOU CAN BUILD**

### Headline
**Reusable Capabilities for AI-Assisted Engineering**

### Copy
Start with one use case. Scale across your organization with reusable platform capabilities.

### Visual Needed:
**Icon Grid (6 capabilities):**
Each with simple icon + label:
1. **Natural Language 3D Interaction** (chat bubble + 3D model icon)
2. **MCP Tool Integration** (puzzle pieces connecting)
3. **Knowledge Graph Engineering** (network nodes + 3D model)
4. **AR Quality Assurance** (AR glasses + checkmark)
5. **Automated 3D Reviews** (AI + checklist icon)
6. **Training Data Pipelines** (database + AI model icon)

---

## **SECTION 5: USE CASES**

### Headline
**From Engineering Reviews to Shopfloor QA**

### Copy
Build AI workflows that scale across your engineering processes.

### Use Case Cards (3-4 cards with icons):
1. **Automated Engineering Review** *(Featured—link to Layer 3 page)*
   - "AI-assisted design checking against standards"
   - [Learn More →]

2. **Requirements Compliance**
   - "Trace design decisions to requirements automatically"

3. **CAD Design QA**
   - "Catch issues during the design phase"

4. **AR-Assisted Shopfloor QA**
   - "Quality checks with AI support on the production line"

### Visual Needed:
**Card layout with icons:**
- Each card has a distinct icon representing the use case
- **Automated Engineering Review card** is visually prominent (larger, or highlighted border)
- Simple illustration inside each card showing the workflow (e.g., 3D model → AI → checkmarks)

## **SECTION 6: WHY INSTANT3DHUB**

### Headline
**Start Small. Scale Smart.**

### Copy
Don't spend months building infrastructure. Start with one engineering use case, then extend across workflows.

### Comparison Table:

| **Building Custom Solutions** | **With instant3Dhub** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Months of integration work | Platform-based approach |
| Prototypes that don't scale | Start small, scale easily |
| Reinvent for each use case | Reusable capabilities |
| Fragile, one-off solutions | Enterprise-grade foundation |

### Visual Needed:
**Timeline Comparison:**
- **Top timeline:** "Custom build" – Long timeline (6-12 months) with milestones: "CAD integration," "PLM connection," "Build use case 1," "Start over for use case 2"
- **Bottom timeline:** "With instant3Dhub" – Short timeline (weeks) with milestones: "Connect platform," "Build use case 1," "Extend to use case 2," "Scale"
